# Address Book Management System

## Introduction

For far too long, we have been burdened by the cumbersome nature of pen and paper to record each other’s contact details. In this ever so dynamic world, people change their contact details far more often now than ever before. The internet age means that rival telecommunication companies are battling out more than ever for your subscription, and with a new phone contract usually comes a new number. The same can be said for email addresses. Constant spam emails and frequent data breaches cause many people to change emails for their own security, and rightfully so. Whatever may be the reason for the lack of stability regarding contact details, this trend is not likely to fade anytime soon. Having said that, pen and paper is no longer a viable option for recording contact details in this day and age. Making changes alone to a single person’s details can quickly turn the page into an inky mess. This is where the Address Book Management System comes into play.

The Address Book Management System is designed to make recording and keeping track of people's contact details a thoughtless task. No longer will correcting contact details be cumbersome, and no longer will people inadvertently create duplicate records. With the Address Book Management System, all this plus more is managed effortlessly by the system, meaning the user must only type in the contact details they want saved. Nothing more and nothing less.

## Problems Solved by This Software

### Data Redundancy

No longer will users be encumbered with hours of bookkeeping and error checking. Humans are susceptible to errors, and even with multiple error checks, mistakes can still occur. With the Account Management System, this is no longer an issue as the system now takes care of these checks. Numerous features have been implemented into this system to ensure that data duplication is now a non-issue. Every new address book entry is checked against the current saved list of entries to ensure that data is not being duplicated, and those same checks are made when editing entries. No longer will users have to trawl through pages and pages to see if they have already made an entry for a specific contact.

### Searching

Searching for a contact’s details would previously be a tedious task. Users of pen and paper to record contact details would have had to scan through pages and pages of details in order to find whoever’s details they may have been looking for. Searching in this manner has various drawbacks: it is very slow, and for those with thousands of entries, it could even take hours to scan through. Searching manually like this is also prone to mistakes, with a high possibility of missing the contact you are looking for. This possibility only increases with the more pages you may have in your paper address book. Fatigue is likely to set in, leading to poorer results when searching in this manner. With the Address Book Management System, however, these issues are a thing of the past. Computer systems do not experience fatigue, meaning the system can perform multiple consecutive searches even with very large contact list sizes without any risk of decreased performance. Additionally, relative to a manual search, the Address Book Management System delivers search results virtually instantly. A task that previously could take hours can now be completed in a second.

### Validation

There is nothing worse than meeting someone that you haven’t seen or spoken to in years, exchanging contact details, and then later finding out you are unable to contact them because you’ve not recorded their contact details properly. With pen and paper, there’s no way of knowing that the details are incorrect at the time of recording. For simpler errors like the phone number being too long, the user may potentially notice this at the time of recording, but this is not guaranteed, and most users are not validating in this manner. Now with the Address Book Management System, errors like these will be apparent at the time of adding entries. Via the use of various checksums, errors in data entry will be significantly reduced compared to manual pen and paper entry. The system will not allow you to save entries with errors and will alert you to them so corrections can be made.

## Benefits

### User Interface

The Address Book Management System comes with a console user interface to make accessing features of the system quick and easy. The user interface allows effective operation and control of the system from the user, while also feeding relevant information back to the user. The user will promptly be informed if a contact has been successfully added or deleted, but will also be informed if they have made any errors and if operations have not been completed as a result. The user will type in the corresponding number of the operation they would like to perform, and the system will guide them into completing the operation with no training needed.

### Speed

We believe that this software would benefit you greatly in regards to the speed of your operations. The software makes it much easier to send broadcast texts/emails to your own customers and even allows you to perform targeted advertising to a select number of customers. Using the Address Book Management System means that hours you may have previously spent getting customer contact details and preparing the broadcast message, or even forgone due to time constraints, can now be done relatively quickly. This allows your business to benefit from increased revenue due to more advertising and thus increased profit.

## Risks

### Errors/Data Validation

While care was taken to ensure that the system has no issues, as with any computer program, there may be bugs and glitches that have managed to slip through during development. Any specific issues can be raised with us, and we will work to rectify them promptly.

A lot of work has been done regarding the system's error checking and validation functionality. But due to the nature of some errors, some may still pass the system's error checking and checksums. The system checksums will ensure that a contact's email and phone number conform to a verified standard. This helps to prevent accidental errors, but in a situation where an incorrectly typed phone number and/or email conforms to the checksum standards, this will likely slip through the system and result in the contact's details being saved on the system. While it will have no effect on the running of the system, this error may only be picked up by the user when the details are to be retrieved, and by then, it may be difficult to reach the specific contact to rectify these details.

### Cyber Attack

The nature of this program is offline, so generally the software is safe from any external threats. However, in a situation where your network has been compromised, there isn’t much security to prevent threat actors from infiltrating and accessing details on the Address Book Management System. Data encapsulation has been used extensively throughout the system to secure data, but a targeted attack will likely circumvent this. Where customer data has been retrieved by attackers, this could mean an investigation and possible fine from the Information Commissioner's Office, as well as bad publicity for your business and loss of customer trust. A fine would increase costs for the business, while everything else could decrease revenue, both resulting in decreased profit.

## Conclusion

Primarily, the software has been designed to make the storage of contact details easier and more accessible for the customer. Based on feedback and testing, we believe that the software achieves this and would be very useful for any company, but we believe yours would benefit greatly from this. The potential for increased sales from much easier and affordable advertising opportunities should not be passed up on. We strongly believe that the actualized positives of the system heavily outweigh the potential negatives for you and your business.
